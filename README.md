# 🛠️ Hollow House Tools  
**A modular toolkit for relational AI research, nervous-system mapping, cognitive pattern analysis, and codex-driven data workflows.**

Hollow House Tools is part of the **HollowHouseInstitute** ecosystem — a set of tools, utilities, and scripts designed to support **relational psychology**, **nervous-system datasets**, **trauma-informed modeling**, and **AI-human interaction research**.  

This repository provides **clean, reusable components** for preprocessing, analysis, metadata handling, anonymization, and codex-structured research pipelines.

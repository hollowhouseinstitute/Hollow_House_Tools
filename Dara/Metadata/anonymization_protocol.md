# Anonymization Protocol

This system uses a multi-layer anonymization protocol:

1. Remove personal names → replace with role identifiers  
2. Remove location data → replace with region codes  
3. Convert exact dates → into relative ranges  
4. Mask identifiable events  
5. Obfuscate third-party gender unless structurally relevant  
6. Ensure records cannot be reverse engineered  
7. Validate via schema prior to processing  

This protocol must be followed for all dataset contributions.
